To create a text-based choose your own adventure game, you could use a programming language like Python. Here is a basic outline of how you could go about creating such a game:

First, you would need to create a storyline for your game. This could be something simple, like a treasure hunt, or something more complex, like a journey through a fantasy world.

Next, you would need to break down the storyline into individual scenes or events. Each scene should have a description of what is happening, and a set of choices that the player can make to determine what happens next.

You would then need to write the code for your game. This would involve creating variables to track the state of the game, such as the player's location or inventory, and writing functions to handle each scene and the choices that the player can make.

To create the actual gameplay, you would need to use a loop to repeat the process of displaying the current scene and the available choices to the player, and then allowing the player to make a choice. The game would continue until the player reaches the end of the storyline or makes a choice that ends the game.

Finally, you could add additional features to your game, such as saving and loading game progress, to make it more interesting and engaging for the player.
