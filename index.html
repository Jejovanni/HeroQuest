   <!-- <p> You are a fierce barbarian warrior, known throughout the land for your strength and skill in combat. 
      One day, you receive a summons from the king, who has a dangerous quest for you to undertake. 
    As you stand before the king, he explains that an evil sorcerer has taken control of a powerful artifact that could destroy 
    the kingdom if it falls into the wrong hands. The king tasks you with retrieving the artifact and bringing it back to him.
    </p>
    <button>Accept quest</button>
    <button>Decline quest</button>

You accept the quest and set out on your journey, determined to succeed and save the kingdom.
As you travel, you come across a fork in the road. Do you:
A) Take the left path, which leads through a dense forest.
B) Take the right path, which winds through treacherous mountains.
C) Ignore the fork in the road and continue straight ahead.
If you choose A:
You make your way through the dense forest, your sword at the ready. After several hours of hacking through underbrush and battling fierce beasts, you come across a clearing. In the center of the clearing stands the sorcerer, guarding the artifact you seek.
Do you:
A) Attack the sorcerer head-on, risking injury in order to retrieve the artifact.
B) Attempt to sneak up on the sorcerer and take him by surprise.
C) Turn back and find another way to retrieve the artifact.
If you choose B:
You carefully make your way around the clearing, trying to stay out of the sorcerer's sight. When you are close enough, you launch yourself at him, catching him off guard and knocking him to the ground. You quickly snatch the artifact and make your escape.
Congratulations, you have successfully completed your quest and saved the kingdom!
If you choose C:
You decide that the risk of attacking the sorcerer head-on is too great, and turn back to find another way to retrieve the artifact. After several days of searching, you come across a hidden cave that leads directly to the sorcerer's lair.
Do you:
A) Enter the cave and face the sorcerer in his own lair.
B) Wait for the sorcerer to leave his lair and then sneak in and take the artifact.
C) Abandon the quest and return to the kingdom, telling the king that the artifact is lost.
If you choose A:
You bravely enter the cave, ready to face the sorcerer and retrieve the artifact. The sorcerer is waiting for you inside, but your strength and skill in combat are more than a match for him. After a fierce battle, you emerge victorious and claim the artifact.
Congratulations, you have successfully completed your quest and saved the kingdom!
If you choose B:-->
